# Hong Kong Style Shrimp Chow Mein Noodles

Hong Kong-style Shrimp Chow Mein Noodles are a classic Chinatown favorite. Slightly crispy and chewy pan-fried noodles combine with umami flavors of shrimp, Shiitake mushrooms, fresh mung bean sprouts, and scallions––everything gets tossed into a hot wok, to get the true MVP ingredient: that wok hay flavor.

Here on the blog, we make a concerted effort to keep tabs and running lists on all of the dishes you request, from the familiar to the obscure. We’ve gotten lots of requests for tasty dishes people have eaten at hole-in-the-wall places in Asia that folks are hoping to recreate at home. The impetus for this recipe was one such request, and we’re pretty happy about it!

It has been a long while since we’ve made a pan-fried noodle dish, but this recipe request came from a reader looking to step up his game and make the move from ordering his favorite Cantonese Hong Kong chow mein dishes at a restaurant to whipping them up at home. While we’ve covered other pan-fried noodle dishes like Chicken Gai See Chow Mein and Honey Hoisin Pan Fried Noodles, this version with shrimp is a new favorite!

These Shrimp Chow Mein Noodles come together quickly once you prepare the fresh ingredients, but there’s one vital detail to keep in mind as you turn to your wok. To get it right at home, you’ll need a crazy hot wok to emulate that seared wok hay flavor everyone craves from their favorite Chinese restaurant.
